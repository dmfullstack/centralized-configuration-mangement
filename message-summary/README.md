# message summary


This is a simple java microservice to search messages sent out by
[go-kafka-alert](https://github.com/malike/go-kafka-alert) and also 
to provide summary of messages sent out by channel that is `EMAIL`, `SMS` 
and `API`.

The intent of this is to show how we can have distributed/cloud native applications written in `Go` 
and `Java` work with a config server to share properties as well to demonstrate dynamic 
reloading of configuration without microservice down time.
